# catdateweight

Data and review for one kitten/cat's weight over time (days), just for fun. Age at initial measurement on 20210623 was between four and six weeks old (five weeks is best estimate).

Notes and things guessed, thought, learned about (by date):

- I've noticed over the months that just the last point or two of data can change my perception of the future trajectory a lot.

- Have been wondering if the variation in change by day is/will-be clearly proportional to his size.

- It seems it's to a point I could fit something to it for prediction pretty well, but am not totally sure (eg if kittens might have another period of some linear growth).

- I thought neat/remarkable: In November he had to wear the cone-collar for a few days, and so I had to adjust for it â€“ even though the differences are so small relative to his overall size, 15g collar vs 33g collar on a ~3.5kg cat, we were able to see a clear break in the series after just two or three days and that I was making the wrong adjustment (was an easy fix, thankfully).

- Anticipated (pre-measurement) weight change for several weeks is gain of approximately one ounce (28.35grams) per day.
