# catdateweight

Data and review for one kitten/cat's weight over time (days), just for fun. Age at initial measurement on 20210623 was between four and six weeks old (five weeks is best estimate).

Notes and things guessed, thought, learned about (by date):

20230330
- He's been sleeping in the box that's easy to put on the scale again lately so can record more. Has increased for sure though I wouldn't know it from just looking at him. 

20220727
- Weighing him less frequently since 20220623, and also at different|more-variable times of day.

20220505
- Switching to weighing him in the morning (rather than evening) after eating starting today. I regret I haven't been measuring/recording more frequently in recent weeks - including that the new twist is interesting, and it would be neat to have better info on the daily-variation. 

- Had to adjust recently for duct-tape that was added to reinforce the box he's typically weighed in, which made me think of Nathan Keyfitz' "Counting the Ration Cards" (http://www.keyfitz.org/nathan/memoir/04.html). None of the recorded data was affected though.

20220428
- A couple weeks ago I was thinking about how abruptly the daily change flattened, imagining a switch turning off. Now the past several days some substantial increase again.  

20220121
- To try to keep variation in change by day down some (for better or worse), have been more mindful the past few weeks to weight him after he eats dinner. 

20220108
- Am realizing that with more variation in change (as he's gotten bigger, and looking forward), specification of when he's completed ~kitten growth could become (maybe very) imprecise.

20220103
- I've noticed over the months that just the last point or two of data can change my perception of the future trajectory a lot.

- Have been wondering if the variation in change by day is/will-be clearly proportional to his size.

- It seems it's to a point I could fit something to it for prediction pretty well, but am not totally sure (eg if kittens might have another period of some linear growth).

- I thought neat/remarkable: In November he had to wear the cone-collar for a few days, and so I had to adjust for it â€“ even though the differences are so small relative to his overall size, 15g collar vs 33g collar on a ~3.5kg cat, we were able to see a clear break in the series after just two or three days and that I was making the wrong adjustment (was an easy fix, thankfully). 

202106
- Anticipated (pre-measurement) weight change for several weeks is gain of approximately one ounce (28.35grams) per day.
