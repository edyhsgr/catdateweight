# catdateweight

Data and review for one kitten/cat's weight over time (days), just for fun. Age at initial measurement on 20210623 was between four and six weeks old (five weeks is best estimate). 

Notes and things guessed/thought/learned (by date):
202106 - Anticipated (pre-measurement) weight change for several weeks is gain of approximately one ounce (28.35grams) per day.

20220103 - Interesting, just the last point or two of data can change my perception of the future trajectory a lot.
  - It seems it's to a point I could fit something to it pretty well, but am not totally sure (eg if kittens might have another period of some linear growth).
  - In November he had to wear the cone-collar for a few days, and so I had to adjust for it â€“ even though the differences are so small relative to his overall size, 15g collar vs 33g collar, we were able to spot a clear break in the series after just two or three days and that I was making the wrong adjustment (was an easy fix, thankfully),
